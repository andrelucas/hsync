TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- Really need progress meters


Features

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Incremental check mode
  - Client side done - mtime match -> no read contents (switchable)

- More useful progress reporting
  - Now shows per-file progress. More to do.

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
