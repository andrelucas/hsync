TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- -X isn't working on server side

- Should really sort directory and file names from os.walk()

- After changes (esp.check metadata) are made, the HSYNC.SIG entry needs updated
  so redundant re-checks on the next run are eliminated.
  (e.g. change length of file, fix but HSYNC.SIG entry may have old values...)

- The progress object percentage number is misleading.

Features

- Add a lockfile

- Compress the signature file

- Transfer statistics

- Wildcard exclude

- Specific include as well as exclude

- Truncate long paths (for display)

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Specify default user and group

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
