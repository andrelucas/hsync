TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Explain filter for dest side in usage

- Reduce memory consumption

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- Remove excluded dirs from the old .SIG file, as well as from the scan.

- Globs aren't very clever. Look at duplicity's '*' vs. '**'.

Features

- Add a built-in way to remove an old lockfile

- Checkpoint the dest signature file.

- Transfer statistics
  - They're kept, so surface them.

- Retry failed downloads?

- Write in-progress downloads to disk instead of memory, like rsync

- Wildcard exclude

- Specific include as well as exclude

- Truncate long paths (for display)

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
