TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Reduce memory consumption

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

Features

- Add metadata to the HSYNC.SIG* file, in top-comments.

- Add a built-in way to remove an old lockfile

- Checkpoint the dest signature file.

- Transfer statistics
  - They're kept, so surface them.

- Write in-progress downloads to disk instead of memory, like rsync

- Truncate long paths (for display)

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Globs aren't very clever. Look at duplicity's '*' vs. '**'.
