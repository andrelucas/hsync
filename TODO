TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- Should really sort directory and file names from os.walk()

- If a file is not fully copied, say so; don't depend on the checksum to catch
   it as that's a misleading error message


Features

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Specify default user and group

- Incremental check mode
  - Client side done - mtime match -> no read contents (switchable)
  - Server side done - mtime match -> no read
  - Could do subtree culling, if mtime is reliable over nfs

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
