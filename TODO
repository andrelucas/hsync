TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Reduce memory consumption

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- Test coverage of hsync.py isn't good enough (nosetests --coverage --cover-html).

- Remove excluded dirs from the old .SIG file, as well as from the scan.


Features

- Add a built-in way to remove an old lockfile

- Compress the signature file

- Transfer statistics

- Retry failed downloads

- Write in-progress downloads to disk instead of memory, like rsync

- Wildcard exclude

- Specific include as well as exclude

- Truncate long paths (for display)

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
  - Test --no-delete mode
