TODO for hsync
==============

Bugs

- Documentation

- Relative filenames
  - '-S .' doesn't work
  - '-U ../blah' doesn't work (puts it in /, probably needs a .normpath()):

- Really need progress meters

- Don't crap out completely on 404s.
  - The remote changing should not stop an overnight sync (maybe should be a toggle)


Features

- Embed version number in script and in output.

- Check the HSYNC.SIG FINAL checksum

- Incremental check mode

- More useful progress reporting

- Better tests
  - Unsupported file types (will currently just die)
